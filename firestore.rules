/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Aravalli Home Studio
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset implements a hybrid security model, balancing public read access for product and gallery information with strict user-ownership for personal data and orders.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /products/{productId}: Publicly readable product catalog.
 * - /users/{userId}: User profiles, accessible only to the owner. The {userId} must match the authenticated user's UID.
 * - /users/{userId}/orders/{orderId}: Orders placed by a specific user, accessible only to the owner.
 * - /galleryItems/{galleryItemId}: Publicly readable gallery items (images, videos).
 * - /greetings/{greetingId}: Publicly readable greeting messages.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public Read Access: Products and gallery items are publicly readable to facilitate easy browsing.
 * - User Ownership: User profiles and orders are strictly controlled by user ownership. Only the authenticated user matching the {userId} can access these resources.
 * - No User Listing: Listing all users is not permitted.
 * - Flexible Schemas: Data validation is relaxed during this prototyping phase to allow for faster development. However, authorization-critical fields (like user IDs) are strictly validated.
