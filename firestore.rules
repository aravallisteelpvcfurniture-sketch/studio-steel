/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for Aravalli Home Studio.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for customer-related data (orders, recommendations).
 * Products and gallery items are considered publicly accessible.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /products/{productId}: Public product catalog.
 * - /customers/{customerId}: Customer profiles, accessible only by the owning user.
 * - /customers/{customerId}/orders/{orderId}: Orders belonging to a specific customer.
 * - /customers/{customerId}/orders/{orderId}/orderItems/{orderItemId}: Items within an order, accessible only by the order's owner.
 * - /customers/{customerId}/recommendations/{recommendationId}: Product recommendations for a customer.
 * - /galleryItems/{galleryItemId}: Public gallery items.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Customers can only access their own data (profile, orders, recommendations).
 * - Public read access is granted for products and gallery items.
 * - No user listing is allowed.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  -  The `customerId` is used in the paths for orders and recommendations to enforce ownership.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - Public data (products, gallery items) is stored in top-level collections, while private user data is stored under /customers/{customerId}.
